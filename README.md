Vanilla RNN classification with pytorch on AG_NEWS dataset. Model achives almost the same accuracy as Vanilla RNN in the paper [Recurrent Neural Network for Text Classification with Hierarchical Multiscale
Dense Connections](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0757.pdf). Implemented model is much faster than RNN from pytorch, however for this dataset it is much better to use architectures like stacked Vanilla RNN or especially LSTM. Code was written just for experimental purposes only, code released to production would be divided into more classes and separate files, both with proper docstrings.
